##### Step 2 : Getting the Data

After that we have downloaded the database from this link [https://codebasics.io/resources/sales-insights-data-analysis-project] (Giving credits to Codebasics), then we will download the database file **db_dump.sql** and import it into our MySQL Workbench.

Now let's talk about the database:


The Sales Database contains 5 tables:
-  customers
-  date
-  markets
-  products
-  transactions

After that we've done some data wrangling using SQL to explore the data before importing it to POWER BI and clean it using Power Query.


#### Step 3 : ETL and Data wrangling using Power Query


We have also exported all the 5 tables into CSV files for those who prefer to work with Excel as a datasource.
